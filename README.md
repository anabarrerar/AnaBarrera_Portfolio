# Project 1: Identifying Age-Related Conditions
Development of a predictive model to determine if an individual has one or more of three specific medical conditions (Class 1) or none of the conditions (Class 0).
Traditionally, the diagnosis of these medical conditions involves a time-consuming and invasive data collection process from patients. By leveraging predictive models, we aim to simplify this process and save patient privacy by focusing on key features associated with conditions and coding them.
* Predictions were made using k-fold stratified cross-validation using ensemble boosting methods, with the metric of balanced logloss used for evaluation.
