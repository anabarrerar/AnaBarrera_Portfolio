## Project 1: Identifying Age-Related Conditions
Development of a predictive model to determine if an individual has one or more of three specific medical conditions (Class 1) or none of the conditions (Class 0).
Traditionally, the diagnosis of these medical conditions involves a time-consuming and invasive data collection process from patients. By leveraging predictive models, we aim to simplify this process and save patient privacy by focusing on key features associated with conditions and coding them.
* Predictions were made using k-fold stratified cross-validation using ensemble boosting methods, with the metric of balanced logloss used for evaluation.

## Project 2: Personalized Diet Recommendation System for Diabetes Management
This project aims to develop a recommendation system that provides personalized dietary recommendations for individuals with diabetes. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms and patient data to analyze dietary patterns, blood glucose levels, medical history, and other relevant factors. Based on this analysis, the system generates personalized meal plans and food suggestions tailored to the individual's specific needs, taking into account factors such as nutritional requirements, food preferences, and lifestyle. The goal is to assist patients in making informed choices about their diet, promoting better glucose control and overall health management.

## Project 3: [Employee Attrition Prediction](https://github.com/anabarrerar/AnaBarrera_Portfolio/blob/main/EmployeeAttrition/EmployeeAttrition%26Performance.ipynb)
This project aims to find a model that can help companies determine the factors influencing an employee's decision to leave. By identifying these factors, companies can focus on improving them to retain talented employees.Through data understanding, preprocessing, and feature selection, two models were built using PyCaret. The first model achieved a recall of 0.81, while the second model had an accuracy of 0.94. These models provide valuable insights for companies to understand and address factors influencing employee attrition, aiding in talent retention efforts.
